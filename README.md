# Curious Note

> Here is [My Curious Note](https://curious-note.vercel.app/) ðŸš€

I made a blog to summerize and share questions about programming + É‘ using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

It will be filled with extremely personal curiosity, so it may be useless to someone.

But, wouldn't something like that be revealed by accumulating such knowledge?

What life and programming have in common is that `there is no right answer`.

Life is full of wrong answer notes,

Programming is also full of incorrect answer notes.

Today, I will build up these incorrect notes,

Until someday I naturally express a wonderful answer.

There is a saying.
